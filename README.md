## Reproduce Xamarin Forms issue #9652

This repository shows a bug within Xamarin Forms targeting UWP >= 16299.

Issue: [[Bug][UWP] Loading wrong Xamarin.Forms.Core.dll](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/issues/9652)

## [Update 2020-04-20]
This is still an issue with Xamarin Forms 4.4 and won't get fixed there:
[Xamarin Forms 4.4 Service Release 6 known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/release-notes/4.4/4.4.0-sr6#known-issues)

But it has been fixed with the [initial release of 4.5 (specifically 4.5.0.282-pre4), now at Service Release 4](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/release-notes/4.5/4.5.0-sr4).
